# csv-unique-values

A script to get unique values from rows in any CSV file.

Our use case is to run this script to populate in-app dropdowns with all possible values,
but there's plenty more you can do with it, for example if you want to remove
duplicates from a list of e-mails or phone numbers, â€¦

## Usage

Pull in this repository locally, then run

```
Usage: node index.js [options]

Options:
  -v, --version             output the version number
  -i, --input <file>        input CSV file
  -k, --keys <keys>         keys to extract, comma-separated, all by default
  -o, --output <directory>  output destination, will create a file per key
  --no-sort                 don't sort unique values
  -h, --help                display help for command
```

If we publish this to NPM, it'd be

```
npx @dbl-works/csv-unique-values [options]
```
